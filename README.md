Wren:AM is a CDDL-licensed, community fork of ForgeRock's OpenAM product. Though our project originated with code that ForgeRock previously released, we are not affiliated with ForgeRock in any way. 

ForgeRock no longer releases any of the most recent versions of their software under an open-source license. ForgeRock’s “Community Edition” versions are much older versions then their commercial offerings. Join our community for the latest and greatest. 

See [wrensecurity.org](https://wrensecurity.org/) and [timeforafork.com](http://www.timeforafork.com/) for more information.

## Preparing Your Build Environment
In order to build Wren:AM from source you need the following software installed:

* Java (OpenJDK) >= 1.7
* Apache Maven >= 3.1.0

## About This Branch (`sustaning/13.x`)
The `sustaining/13.x` branch is a stable branch, intended for bug and security fixes against versions of Wren:AM that were originally part of ForgeRock's OpenAM 13.0 major-point release. You will *not* find any of the features or enhancements from AM 13.5 in this branch (see `sustaining/13.5.x` for those).

## Building Wren:AM
Wren:AM is fully buildable from source.

**If you have previously built OpenAM or other ForgeRock products from source, you are strongly encouraged to clear your local `~/.m2/repository` before building Wren:AM for the first time.**

This step is necessary because Wren artifacts in this version of AM have the same Maven artifact IDs that ForgeRock originally used for the corresponding artifacts, but our copies contain modifications to source from our Maven repositories. This was necessary because ForgeRock's repositories are no longer publicly accessible.

After clearing your local repository of conflicting ForgeRock artifacts, clone the `wrenam` repository and checkout the `sustaining/13.x` branch:

```
$ git clone -b sustaining/13.x https://github.com/WrenSecurity/wrenam.git
$ cd wrenam
$ mvn clean install
```
