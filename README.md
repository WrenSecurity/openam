wren:am is a CDDL-licensed, community fork of ForgeRock's OpenAM product. Though our project originated with code that ForgeRock previously released, we are not affiliated with ForgeRock in any way. 

ForgeRock no longer releases any of the most recent versions of their software under an open-source license. ForgeRock’s “Community Edition” versions are much older versions then their commercial offerings. Join our community for the latest and greatest. 

See [wrensecurity.org](http://wrensecurity.org/) for more information.

## Preparing your build environment

In order to build wren:AM from source you need the following software installed:

* Java (OpenJDK) >= 1.7
* Apache Maven >= 3.1.0

## Building wren:AM

wren:am is fully build-able, however currently not all required artifacts (dependencies) are deployed to public artifact repositories. Therefor there are 2 repositories which you need to clone to install all required artifacts in to your local `~/.m2/repository` location. Our current progress on getting all artifacts in public repositories with verifiable sources can be tracked in this [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HUEprS3Mdm7vxtkPhGu8UYVh0U5V9j1p-dj0bXYhGOs/edit?usp=sharing).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/WrenSecurity/wrensec-deps.git
$ pushd wrensec-deps
$ ./install_wrenam_13_deps.sh
$ popd
```
```
$ git clone https://github.com/WrenSecurity/forgerock-xui-deps.git
$ pushd forgerock-xui-deps
$ git checkout sustaining/13
$ ./install.sh
$ popd
```

After installing all required artifacts, clone the `wrenam` repository and checkout the `sustaining/13` branch:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/WrenSecurity/wrenam.git
$ cd wrenam
$ git checkout -b sustaining/13 origin/sustaining/13
$ mvn clean install
```

## Contributing

Contributing to wren:AM is easy! Just create a GitHub pull request!

We do however ask that you run the `precommit` Maven profile which checks your codestyle among things.

```
$ mvn clean install -P precommit
```

Some legacy code will fail, so if you are modifying an existing module you should run this profile before modifying the code, and then run the profile again after modifications to ensure the number of reported issues has not increased.
